These files produce the plots in the paper titled
Existence of positive steady states for mass-conserving
and mass-action weakly reversible chemical reaction
networks with a single linkage class.

The scripts contained are:
infeas_plot_os.m plots the mass action infeasibility for the iterations of the solver 
                 for an open system with one likage class 
infeas_plot_om.m plots the mass action infeasibility for the iterations of the solver
                 for an open system with two linkage classes
infeas_plot_cs.m plots the mass action infeasibility for the iterations of the solver 
                 for a closed syste with one likage class 
infeas_plot_cm.m plots the mass action infeasibility for the iterations of the solver
                 for a closed system with two linkage classes

./avg_iterations_for_nw_size_multiple.m Generates a file in ../Results/NetworkSizeVsItCountSingleLink.mat that
                                can be used to plot the average iteration count over different network sizes for 
                                networks with two linkage classes.
./avg_iterations_for_nw_size_single.m Generates a file in ../Results/NetworkSizeVsItCountSingleLink.mat that 
                                can be used to plot the average iteration count over different network sizes for 
                                networks with one linkage class.
./plot_avg_iterations_vs_nw_size.m Uses the two files in ./Results to plot the averate iteration count vs netowrk size.
./Generator/AkGenerator.m Generates a weakly reversible reacion network with a prescribed number
                          of complexes and linkage classes.
./Generator/YGenerator.m  Generates a stoichiometry matrix
./Generator/GrTheory/*    Used by AkGenerator to count the number of linkage classes in a 
                          sampled network.

./CRNTSolvers/SolverFpIterationHomPDCO.m
./CRNTSolvers/SolverFpIterationInhomPDCO.m
./PDCO/pdco.m Michael Saunders's primal dual constrained optimization software
