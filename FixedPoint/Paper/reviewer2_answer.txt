Comment 1:
Keywords removed

Comment 2:
Mathematics subject classification removed

3: Corrected

4: Corrected

5: Originally correct but the notation was confusig, the notation has now been changed.

6: Changed mass-conserving to conservative throughout the paper, and adapted the 
    description of the vector e to the reviewer's suggestion.
   We choose to keep the definition of conservative in the mathematical terms presented
   since it is directly used in several parts of the mathematical analysis.

7: The title now reads weakly reversible networks with a single linkage class. 
    Removed the incorrect definition and adjusted the language throughout the paper.
    For example Theorem 2 now reads "For a conservative weakly reversible network with one linkage class" 
instead of "For a mass conserving single terminal linkage network"  

8:Definition 3 is now Definition 2 and has been changed to reflect the reviewer's suggestion.

9: Corrected

10 - 11: The concept of deficiency is not used anymore and the discussion has been removed.

12: The suggestion to change $R^{n+1}$ to $R^n X R$ was incorporated.
    y: refers to the dual variable associated to the constraint. The 
symbol has been removed from the problem definition for clarity.
    A reference has been added for the 
origin of the first-order optimality conditions.
